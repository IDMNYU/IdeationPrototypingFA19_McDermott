# Written Assignment Guidelines

As with all written work, proofread for spelling and grammar. 

Any printed work that you will turn in, should always contain the following:

*   Date
*   Your first and last name
*   Ideation &amp; Prototyping
*   Fall 2018
*   McDermott

All written assignments should be submitted as a pdf on NYU classes assignment pages.
