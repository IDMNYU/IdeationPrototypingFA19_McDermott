# Labs

This course is designed to follow a studio model. We will have several hands-on "lab" lessons during class-time. 
Some of the labs will include the use of handtools. On these days, you should wear close-toed shoes, pants, and have hair tied back.
Please check the course calendar and weekly updates to make sure you are dressed appropriately. 

Lab participation is part of your participation grade, 10% of your grade total. Concepts and techniques learned in labs can be applied to your assignments and projects.
