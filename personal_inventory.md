# Personal Inventory

Create a personal inventory of at least three objects that you possess which reveal something about you. Use your smart phone or a video camera to record footage of the objects along with audio narration or written commentary. Upload the video to YouTube, Vimeo, or NYU Stream, then embed the video in your process website. Alternatively, you may take photos of the objects in question, and include accompanying written descriptions on your process website.
