# I. Classmate Discovery: Due 10/31

Step 1: Pair up with someone in the class whom you haven't worked with before.

Step 2: Interview your partner. Find out about their background, training, discipline, and the personal circumstances that led them to where they are todayâ€”and indicates where they are going. Look at the material that your classmate has posted to their process website so far, including their three personal objects, and day in the life assignment. Take a look at their social media as well. Make a visual map or infographic of their interests and influences.

# II. Collaborative Constant Input-Output: Due 11/07  

Step 3: Your partner has also made a map/portrait of you. Look at your maps together. Look for points of commonality or difference. Put your normal Constant Input on hold this week, and produce a collaborative post together.
