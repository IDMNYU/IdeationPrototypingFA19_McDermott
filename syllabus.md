## Welcome to Ideation &amp; Prototyping!

In this class, the creative process will be investigated in order to generate ideas for art, design, technology, and business endeavors. The course will show how ideation, design research &amp; thinking, and prototyping can inspire, inform, and bring depth to what one ultimately creates. Students will expand their arsenal of design research skills, learn how to think critically about their audience, content, form, and processes, as well as, understand the importance of utilizing more than one research and design strategy.

Prerequisite: None

### PROGRAM GOALS

The following Integrated Digital Media program goals are introduced and reinforced within this course. Students will:

*   develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
*   develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.
*   develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historical, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
*   develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

### COURSE GOALS

To facilitate students to:
*	develop a rigorous, iterative process for looking, questioning, thinking, making, and
communicating that challenges assumptions and preconceived ideas
*	use their imagination to create something entirely new & innovative OR to reinvent an
old idea into something new
*	introduce students to the many research & design methodologies available to them
*   develop skills of description, research, analysis, visualization, design and critical
thinking.
*	think critically about their audience, content, form, and processes
*	improve writing, documentation, and presentation skills
*	facilitate collaboration



### LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of the course students will be better equipped:
to identify and analyze inspirational and research material, search and spot ideas, and transform invisible ideas into visible realizations. Bring ideas and thoughts into the physical/tangible space, incorporate feedback into their production process.



### COURSE STRUCTURE

The course will closely follow a studio model, with students actively creating and sharing work in class. Creative production will be supplemented with lectures, screenings and critical discussions of required readings. The topics and techniques covered in the course can be grouped into four categories, (which sometimes overlap): *Inspiration, Research, Iteration and Prototyping.* Smaller assignments are designed to improve student skills in these four areas, and to contribute to a framework of understanding which students can draw on when approaching larger projects. 

Rules of the Critique:
* Be Present and Engaged
* Give Feedback to your classmates
* Do NOT take feedback personally.

**/Inspiration/**
* Observing, watching, seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, smelling, feeling 
* Collecting, cataloging, obsessing, hoarding, exploring, questioning

**/Research/**
* Analyzing and learning from inspirations
* Reading scholarly research, popular media, and fiction
* First hand observations, interviews, sketches, notes, photographs, recording and video
* Establishing framework and research question
* Designing experiments

**/Iteration/**
* Brainstorming, automatic writing
* Modifying/repurposing/building on existing
* Material experiments and tests
* Sketches, photos, models
* Sharing/presenting work, checking ideas in relation to framework and research question, repeating the iteration process.  

**/Prototyping/** 
* Modifying/repurposing/building on existing objects, models, images, audio, and video
* Creating renderings, images, 3-D models, collages, textures
* Draft models: paper, cardboard, wire, paper maché, fabric
* Rapid prototyping: 3-D printing, CNC milling, Laser cut stencils, slice forms, signs  
* Performing, testing, documenting in context
* Checking result in relation to research question, repeating the prototyping process.  


### STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES

* Schedule your time (keep a calendar of some sort) 
* Come to class on time and participate (be present and engaged)
* Devote at a minimum 4 to 8 hours per week outside of class, fulfilling homework assignments, reading, and studying concepts covered in class.
* Complete all assignments by due dates
* Acquire and read all assigned readings before they are due
* Schedule a meeting to talk to me in person about issues and problems.
* Have patience, persistence, and discipline 
* Pay attention to detail & craft
* Have self-confidence and pride in your work
* Take risks & be fearless in your projects
* Have fun!


### EVALUATION & GRADING

##### Attendance

You cannot participate if you are absent from class. If you are going to be absent from class you must contact me by email. A single unexcused absence will result in an email between the student, instructor, and program director. More than two unexcused absences will result in a full letter grade reduction (e.g., B –> C) in the class participation portion of your grade. The class is small so it will be obvious if you are not present.

#### Your final grade will be based on a synthesis of quantitative &amp; qualitative rubrics:

* Makeup assignments are only available when discussed with and approved by the instructor in advance of the due date.
* Each student will be judged on the commitment, fearlessness, and continuous improvement that their work shows. Incomplete or unsatisfactory work will receive a failing grade.

##### Qualitative Grading Overview

##### A. Excellent (90-100: Work of exceptional quality; Exceeds Expectations)
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. The student thoroughly understands the theory and practice behind ideation &amp; prototyping.

##### B. Very Good / Good (80-89: Work of high quality)
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average understanding of ideation &amp; prototyping theory & practice.

##### C. Satisfactory (70-79: Average; Satisfies course requirements)
Performance and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of ideation &amp; prototyping theory & practice.

##### D. Poor; Below Average (60-69: Deficient, but passing)
Performance and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many or most areas that show any understanding of ideation &amp; prototyping. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning and poor craft.

##### F. Unacceptable (59 & Below: Failing Course Requirements)
Performance and attendance of the student has been such that course requirements have not been met. Work shows no overall understanding of the course material on many levels or either a severe lack of interest. 

### TECHNOLOGY USE IN THE CLASSROOM

Laptop computers and other mobile devices are invaluable tools for artists, designers, and students when used responsibly. However, this technology can also be incredibly distracting, especially in the classroom. When in class, you may use your laptops and other devices for any activities pertaining to the course: taking notes, researching material relevant to our readings and discussions, doing VFS homework, making class presentations, etc. However, the following uses are unacceptable: checking email, instant messaging, texting, using social networking sites such as facebook, etc. Also, during class screenings, your laptops should not be used.


### ACADEMIC HONESTY

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA style for citing and documenting source material.
