# Reading Responses 

Reading responses can be short, 200 words, and should include a question or a point you wish to discuss further in class.
Rather than summarizing or quoting the text directly, reading responses should reflect your reaction to or opinion on concepts discussed in the readings. 
Turn in reading responses on NYU Classes at least 1 hour before class, and/or bring a hardcopy to class. 

*On weeks in which two readings are assigned, two responses are required. 

Your reading response grade is rpart of your participation grade, which is 10% of your total course grade.
