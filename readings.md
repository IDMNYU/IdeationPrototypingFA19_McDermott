#### Design For the Real World

The key text for this course is Victor Papanek's *Design for The Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change* (2nd
Edition), (Chicago: Academy Chicago Publishers), 2000

There are several copies available in the library, in part because this book has been re-released several times. 
Though I will reference the copy released in the year 2000, the content across all editions is very similar.
Library call numbers for different editions can be found here:

You may access the book as a [PDF.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dlHsKc6HtuD_uylvQtj2v9GxIzk_AsdJ) 
You may read it as an E-book if you make an account [here.](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL5705411M/Design_for_the_real_world)

Or you may purchase the book in the school store, or on Amazon. Though there are aspects of the language which are dated, this is fundamentally a classic text and "the world's most read book on design" according to its publisher, [Academy Chicago,](http://www.designersandbooks.com/book/design-real-world) so it may be a worthwhile purchase.
