#### Design For the Real World

The key text for this course is Victor Papanek's *Design for The Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change* (2nd
Edition), (Chicago: Academy Chicago Publishers), 2000

There are several copies available in the library, in part because this book has been re-released several times. 
Though I will reference the copy released in the year 2000, the content across all editions is very similar.
Library call numbers for different editions can be found here:

You may access the book as a [PDF. (NYU Account only or else you have to request access)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-hOsbIhKOt3e51_DoTJa2wU6X1YKUayb/view?usp=sharing)

You may read it as an E-book if you make an account [here.](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL5705411M/Design_for_the_real_world)
<-- a note on open library: the books available are mostly scans. It has an egalitarian goal in terms of knoweledge sharing, but some authors are opposed to it. You can decide whether you support it or not. It is at least a better alternative to sites like bestbooklibrary, which is most likely a scam. 

Lastly, you may purchase the book in the school store, or on Amazon. Though there are aspects of the language which are dated, this is fundamentally a classic text and "the world's most read book on design" according to its publisher, [Academy Chicago,](http://www.designersandbooks.com/book/design-real-world) so it may be a worthwhile purchase.
