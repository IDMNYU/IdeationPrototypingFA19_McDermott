# Creative Process Presentation, Bibliography and Creative Work

### Part01: 
Research, analyze, evaluate, and communicate the research & design *processes* of a creator from a discipline of your choice. Present this research in a 5 minute Powerpoint or video, with citations of at least 10 separate sources throughout. *At least five of the sources must be academic (books, journal articles, museum catalogs)* Cite your sources throughout your presentation and also post a bibliography to your website. Use [Chicago] (https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/chicago_manual_17th_edition/chicago_manual_of_style_17th_edition.html) or MLA format. 
The process presentation will reveal the discoveries you made about your subject, as well as how these discoveries will inform or have informed your own creative processes. Include: Studies or drawing of what you are consider to make for part 02.

The key to your research is a proliferation of references on your subject, particularly interviews, sketchbooks, notebooks, and/or journals or other reflective writing which can give you insights into the research and design processes of your subject.

### Bibliography

*The Wikipedia Disclaimer: Nowadays, wikipedia is often the starting point for research – it’s quick, easy, and provides an acceptable overview of many subjects. However, for serious, sustained research Wikipedia should not be relied upon as a primary source. Use Wikipedia to familiarize yourself with your subject and to locate other sources for further research.*

Remember that you can use as many non-academic sources as you like, such as interviews in magazines and blogs– but you also need at least 5 academic sources (books, journal articles, museum catalogs). Format your bibliography in [Chicago MLA format.](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/chicago_manual_17th_edition/chicago_manual_of_style_17th_edition.html)

You can access NYU’s central library here: [http://library.nyu.edu/](http://library.nyu.edu/)

You can access NYU Tandon’s Bern Dibner Library here: [http://library.poly.edu/](http://library.poly.edu/)

[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is another good starting point, if you find an interesting article or book that it is behind a paywall, try searching for the title in the NYU library.  

**Part 01 Due date: 09/18**


### Part 02

Now that you have studied the process of the creator of your choice, make it your own. Apply their process to the creative output of your choosing. For example, if you have chosen to research Edison, who made hundreds of iterations before creating the electric lightbulb, you may choose to create 10 iterations of a design for a wind-powered tablet, and build one. If you have chosen Salvador Dalí, whose process included awaking himself from sleep repeatedly before painting, you may apply that process to a graphic design project. Your final outcome should be finished and exhibition ready.  

Unless you have requested and received an OK from me, this should not be a powerpoint. The format of your work should allow it stand on its own, outside a presentation context. 

**Part 02 Due date: 09/30** (updated 9/18)
