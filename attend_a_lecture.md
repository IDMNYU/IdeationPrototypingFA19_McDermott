~# Attend a Lecture
Attend a lecture, performance or exhibition, submit a 500 word write-up to the assignments page in classes giving a quick summary of the event, and more importantly, your reaction to it. 
More suggestions on possible events to visit will be given later in the semester. 
If you have an event in mind, and aren't sure if it will satisfy the course requirements, send the instructor a quick email to verify or ask in person.~

# Prepare for Final Exhibition

Because the exhibition requirement was added late, I have waived the attend a lecture assignment. Instead, you will be graded on your compliance with our curator's request for your exhibition materials / files to be delivered to her by December 11th.
