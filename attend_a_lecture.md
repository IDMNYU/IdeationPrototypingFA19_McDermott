# Attend a Lecture
Attend a lecture, performance or exhibition, submit a 500 words write-up to the assignments page in classes giving a quick summary of the event, and more importantly, your reaction to it. 
More suggestions on possible events to visits will be given later in semester. 
If you have an event in mind, and aren't sure if it will satisfy the course requirements, send the instructor a quick email to verify or ask in person.
