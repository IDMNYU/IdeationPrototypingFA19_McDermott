Attend a lecture, talk or exhibition, submit a short write-up to assignments page in classes. 
More suggestions on possible events to visits will be given later in semester. 
If you have an event in mind, and aren't sure if it will satisfy the course requirements, send the instructor a quick email to verify or ask in person.
