# Future Dystopia / Utopia Project

_This project can be done as a team or as an individual._

First establish the conditions of the future utopia/dystopia in which your object will exist, You will be working within the limitations you have set. What does your imagined future look, sound, and feel like? (your framing **story**)

Then, develop a design for an object/app/technology which will be useful in this future context. Your final project may take the form of a rendering, model, object, photo or video, (documentation or speculative). 

I suggest brainstorming one or more of the following themes to get you started, but you will need to eventually drill down from these very broad themes to specificity:

*   Animals
*   Commerce
*   Education
*   Engineering
*   Ethics
*   Information
*   Materiality
*   Media: Moving Image, Photography, Painting, Print, Sound, etc.
*   Memory
*   Nature
*   Networks
*   Ruins
*   Science
*   Sexuality
*   Systems
*   The Object
*   Technology
*   Time

### Write up

Turn in a short (500 words) write-up explaining your process and reflecting on your results. You may also reflect on the feedback you received in critique, and on any changes you would make to improve the project. This will be due to NYU Classes during the reading period.
