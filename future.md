# Future Dystopia / Utopia Project

_This project can be done as a team or as an individual._

#### Part I
First establish the conditions of the future utopia/dystopia in which your project will exist, You will be working within the limitations you have set. What does your imagined future look, sound, and feel like? (your framing **story**) Then, develop a design for an object/app/technology which will be useful in this future context. Make a mock-up of your design.

#### Part II
Incorporate your design into a short video (3-5 min). If you have been able to create a functional prototype, your video can document and showcase that functionality. If your object is more speculative / imaginative, your video can be more like a fiction, and show the conditions of the world you have designed. 

#### Notes
I suggest brainstorming one or more of the following themes to get you started, but you will need to eventually drill down from these very broad themes to specificity:

*   Animals
*   Commerce
*   Education
*   Engineering
*   Ethics
*   Information
*   Materiality
*   Media: Moving Image, Photography, Painting, Print, Sound, etc.
*   Memory
*   Nature
*   Networks
*   Ruins
*   Science
*   Sexuality
*   Systems
*   The Object
*   Technology
*   Time

### Write up: Due during the reading period 

Turn in a short (500 words) write-up explaining your process and reflecting on your results. You may also reflect on the feedback you received in critique, and on any changes you would make to improve the project. This will be due to NYU Classes during the reading period.
