# Project 3: Designing “Seatbelts” for Technology 

_Individual or Groups of 2_

Choose a common object, tool, or technology as your “site.” Research the history of your chosen object, when was it invented, by whom and how has it changed over the years? 

A. "Cradle to Grave." Pick a durable household product, something that gets a lot of consistent use. Spend time researching it and analyzing it. How is it made? How does the process start? How does it end? How long does it last? 

Represent the product life cycle visually in a way that is easy to comprehend. Represent its use of material resources, its deterioration, its birth, from cradle to grave in a way that is accessible and in a digestible format. 

B. Consider how in a utopic or dystopic future scenario, your chosen site may be misused. Design something to help prevent this misuse: for example, ear muffs for Alexa. (Utopic alternative: design a positive use/adaption for a tool that is normally associated with the opposite.) 
* Create studies, tests, and prototypes for early scheduled feedback. 
* Create a final version of the design based on feedback and any further findings from your studies. Document your design in a way that builds a narrative around it. Recommended: staged or manipulated photograph, short video, or GIF.
* Your final work should be finished and exhibition ready.

### Documentation: Due the last of class 

Turn in a short (500 words) write-up and documentation package explaining your process and reflecting on your results. You may also reflect on the feedback you received in critique, and on any changes you would make to improve the project.
