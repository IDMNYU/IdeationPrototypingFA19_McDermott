# EXTRA CREDIT ... AKA Creative Process Reboot

If you were unhappy with your grade for project 01, or if you just want some extra credit, you can complete the following assignment:

Make something using *a similar process* as the person you profiled for the Creative Process assignment. For example, Edison's process involved doing many iterations of similar experiments over and over again to try to solve 1 specific problem. Miyazaki's process involved getting into the mindset of a child. Dal√Æ's process involves tapping into the unconscious brain. Kahlo combined life experiences, memory and emotions, with observations of herself in the mirror (drawing from life). 

Make a post on your website with an image of what you created (or sound or text), and a description of the *process* you followed, and whose work it was based on.  

Due Date: October 31st
