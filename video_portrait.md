# Video Self-Portrait 

Create a short (2â€“5 minute) video self-portrait. The only requirement is that you must not use footage of yourself directly. For example, you may tell a story (literal or abstract) through objects, you may produce a first-person account and take us through a day in your life, you may employ friends to create a re-enactment...I encourage you to be as creative as possible, and choose a story-telling medium that is meaningful to you.    

Turning it in: If you are not comfortable uploading your video to Vimeo, upload it to your google drive and give link-sharing access for NYU view-only. Post the link to Slack. 

Further limitations for next version: no background music, unless you've created it. stock footage and stock sound effects can be used sparingly, but should primarily be original content. make sure you video reveals something about you. storyboard before you begin.
